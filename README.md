#  MARRUS.SH WEBRING  #

This is just a simple webring for people I know or think are cool.
Affiliation does not necessarily imply endorsement yada yada.

##  Using the Webring  ##

It's easy!
Just include the following links in your website:

 -  __Webring index :__
    `https://marrus-sh.github.io/webring/#id`
 -  __Previous page :__
    `https://marrus-sh.github.io/webring/?previous#id`
 -  __Next page :__
    `https://marrus-sh.github.io/webring/?next#id`
 -  __Random page :__
    `https://marrus-sh.github.io/webring/?random#id`

â€¦where `id` is the webring id of your site.
You can also use `prev` instead of `previous` or `rand` instead of `random`.
