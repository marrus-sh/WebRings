		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>This webring aims to collect sites which meet the following criteria :—</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Managed by a human being</strong> (not a corporation) who wants to <strong>form homosocial (same-gender) relationships with girls.</strong> 
					You do not have to identify <em>as</em> a girl but you do have to identify <em>with</em> girls and have a gender somewhere alongside—rather than against or across from—girldom. 
					And you have to be okay with belonging to something called <cite>The EZINE💀💖EGIRL WebRing</cite>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The purpose of this webring is to <strong>facilitate developing the sorts of social networks / support structures which girls like to make</strong>, so the more of a huge lesbo you are (in theory if not in practice) the more successful you are going to be. 
					I <em>do not give a fuck</em> where you position yourself with regards to such dichotomies as “masculinity” / “femininity”, “butch” / “femme”, “top” / “bottom”, <em>etc.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Webpages managed by multiple people (still not a corporation) are permitted if the <em>majority</em> of them fit the above, and the remainder are fine with those folks taking the spotlight.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Not·for·profit</strong> and <strong>freely‐accessible</strong>. 
					Links to storefronts or tipjars somewhere on the page is fine, but you need to be able to view the page for free. 
					<a href="https://creativecommons.org/"><u>Creative Commons</u></a> licensing of content is <em>preferred</em>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Featuring webpages which are:</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Handmade:</strong> 
							Written and styled by hand. 
							Embedded XSLT or HTML custom elements are fine. 
							Pages generated from SXML, Market Commons, or similar are acceptable so long as the source file is selfcontained and others can reproduce the process; in this case, you <em>must</em> link to the source file with a <code>&lt;link rel="alternate"></code> tag in the <code>&lt;head></code> of the document.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Selfcontained:</strong> 
							Content can be downloaded to disk as a single file and viewed without a network connection. 
							Loading nonessential content from elsewhere is okay so long as you provide fallbacks which are acceptable.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Remixable:</strong> 
							Source code must be unminified and readable. 
							Comments explaining aspects of page construction are appreciated.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					These pages do not need to be the only pages on a site, but they <strong>must make up a significant, easily discoverable portion.</strong> 
					For example, a website with a “library” section that meets these requirements is fine, even if that website contains multiple other sections.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How To Join</h2>
		<p>If you have a webpage which you think meets the criteria above, contact <a href="https://go.KIBI.family/About/#me"><u>kibigo!</u></a> with the following information :—</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the URL of your website;</li>
			<li>your website’s name, as you would like it to appear here;</li>
			<li>an <a href="https://go.kibi.family/Apps/NCName/">NCName</a> which you would like your website to be identified by (this is permanent—so don't use anything which might not survive an identity crisis in 10 years); and</li>
			<li>your own name(s) and (optionally) URLs.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Be sure to contact her again if any of these details change.</p>
		<p>
			Once you are added to the WebRing, you <em>must</em> place the following <code>&lt;iframe></code> somewhere prominent on your site’s main page (the one being linked to) :—
		</p>
		<pre><code>&lt;iframe src="https://go.KIBI.family/WebRings/💀💖/embed/#/YOUR-SITE-ID" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-top-navigation">&lt;/iframe></code></pre>
		<p>
			—: (replacing <code>YOUR-SITE-ID</code> with your own site identifier). 
			This will produce something like the following :—
		</p>
		<iframe src="https://go.KIBI.family/WebRings/💀💖/embed/#/kibigo" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-top-navigation"/>
		<p>
			Including this code is necessary so that people traversing the WebRing sequentially can easily continue on their way.
